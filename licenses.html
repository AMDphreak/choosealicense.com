<p>A software license is a set of rules that the software developer sets for the usage of his software source code. Software Licensing is how programmers and businesses tell other programmers, users, and businesses what they are allowed to do with the software's source code, and is enforcible via legal actions. Licenses reflect the philosophy of the individual, organization, or business that owns the software. The owner decides whether they want to have total control over their programs or allow others to re-use their code for things they may not have intended, like controlling a toaster or even a nuclear reactor, or just copy/pasting parts of the code into their own software. Programmers that exclude other people from viewing, testing, and modifying source code use 'closed source' licenses, as was popularized by Microsoft Windows, Adobe Photoshop, and most other software companies in the late 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Other programmers believe in sharing their code and inviting other people to inspect, critique, and improve their code, and this is called 'open source' software. Taking this a step further is 'Free (Libre) Software', wherein the programmer makes their software honest and transparent to the user, which is important to users that want to know that they are using a secure system that respects their rights and freedoms within the digital world and does not arbitrarily and unfairly remove the user's control over his/her computer, similar to how a car manufacturer would allow a user to modify or repair his own vehicle. Free Software is often included in the umbrella term 'open source'. Open source licenses grant permission to everyone to use, modify, and share licensed software for any purpose, subject to conditions (stipulations) preserving the provenance (credit given to the original distributor or creator) and openness of the software. The following licenses are arranged from the one with no conditions (the Unlicense) to the one with the most conditions (GNU AGPLv3). Notice that the popular licenses featured on the <a href="/">home page</a> (GNU GPLv3 and MIT) fall within this spectrum.</p>

The above licenses provide a complete picture of the range of licenses that qualify as 'open source', from highly protective to unconditional. One of these should work for most new open source projects. Many other open source licenses exist, including older versions of and close substitutes for some of the above.
